On the 26th of April 1986 a catastrophe broke out 12 kilometres off the Belarusian border. It was the major break-down of the power unit at the Chernobyl nuclear power station. It is the most severe catastrophe throughout the entire world history of the atomic energy use by its scale, complexity and long-term consequences. As the result of the explosion of the failed reactor a huge amount of radioactive substances was released into the atmosphere. Later on they left the large fall-out «spots» on the ground surface. 23% of the territory of Belarus, 4,8% of the territory of the Ukraine and 0,5% of the territory of Russia were contaminated.
